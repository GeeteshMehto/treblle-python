Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:

- Real-time API monitoring and logging
- Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
- API analytics
- Quality scoring
- One-click testing
- API managment on the go
- and more...

## Requirements

- requests

## Dependencies

- [`django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## Installation

You can install Treblle for django via [PYPi](https://pypi.org/). Simply run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install treblle
```

Don't forget to load the required python modules in your setting.py like so:


**Include "treblle" to your INSTALLED_APPS:**


```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'treblle',
]
```

**Include "TreblleMiddleware" to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:**

```py
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'treblle.middleware.TreblleMiddleware',
)
```

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your **setting.py** file like so for django:

```py
TREBLLE_API_KEY = "_YOUR_API_KEY_"
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID = "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_"
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding that line of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.


### Need to hide additional fields?


If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by using the `TREBLLE_HIDDEN_JSON_KEYS` setting like in the example below.

```py
TREBLLE_HIDDEN_JSON_KEYS = ["secretField", "highlySensitiveField"]
```
